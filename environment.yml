# Conda/Mamba environment for eyeprep development and runtime
# Usage:
#   mamba env create -f eyeprep/environment.yml
#   mamba activate eyeprep
#   (run from the repository root so the editable install `-e .` resolves correctly)
#
# Update environment after changes:
#   mamba env update -f eyeprep/environment.yml --prune
#
# Notes:
# - eye2bids is installed via a VCS URL (GitHub).
# - eyeprep is installed in editable mode so local code changes are immediately reflected.
# - Add/remove conda dependencies below as the project evolves.
